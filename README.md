# oxidt-kit

Small, dependency-light Rust crates for SaaS backends — the pieces that every
app ends up re-implementing. Extracted from several apps that each carried their
own copy, so a fix lands once instead of once per app.

Formerly `hauju/dx-kit` with `dx-*` crate names. The old `dx-*-v*` tags still
resolve through GitHub's redirect, so pinned apps keep building; new releases
are tagged `oxidt-*-v*`.

| crate | what it is |
|---|---|
| [`oxidt-crypto`](crates/oxidt-crypto) | secure random, Argon2 hashing, SHA-256 lookup hashes, API-key / CSRF / invitation tokens, PKCE `S256`, AES-256-GCM at rest |
| [`oxidt-smtp`](crates/oxidt-smtp) | Lettre-backed SMTP — pooled sync/async clients with retry and timeouts, plus a one-shot per-tenant sender |
| [`oxidt-auth`](crates/oxidt-auth) | FerrisKey OIDC, custom login UI (passkey / password / email-OTP), sessions, CSRF, rate limiting, and an optional self-owned WebAuthn Relying Party |
| [`oxidt-umami`](crates/oxidt-umami) | self-hosted Umami analytics — same-origin tracker proxy (ad-blocker bypass, forwards `X-Forwarded-For` so countries survive), client event bridge with numeric revenue props, session identify, script mount |
| [`oxidt-s3`](crates/oxidt-s3) | S3-compatible object storage with its own SigV4 signer over the kit's reqwest stack — put/get/head/list/copy/delete, presigned GET/PUT, retry, errors by cause; no SDK |
| [`oxidt-monitor`](crates/oxidt-monitor) | the surface the central project board polls — `GET /health` liveness and bearer-guarded `GET /api/admin/metrics` KPIs, over an app-supplied source trait |
| [`oxidt-billing`](crates/oxidt-billing) | provider-neutral subscription state, a small plan catalog and access/seat rules — Serde only, usable on the server and in WASM |
| [`oxidt-stripe`](crates/oxidt-stripe) | Stripe Checkout, Billing Portal and signed-webhook client — provider HTTP and response types, no SQL or sessions |
| [`oxidt-polar`](crates/oxidt-polar) | Polar API client and standard-webhooks verification, keyed by your own customer UUID |
| [`oxidt-creem`](crates/oxidt-creem) | Creem Checkout, customer portal, subscription and signed-webhook client, plus the signed return URL |

All are storage-agnostic: no database dependency, no ORM types in any public
signature. `oxidt-auth` reaches storage through the `AuthUserStore`,
`AuthEmailSender` and `AuthRateLimitStore` traits, which the host app
implements. `oxidt-billing` is the provider-neutral core; `oxidt-stripe`,
`oxidt-polar` and `oxidt-creem` are the provider clients and depend on neither
the app nor each other.

## Using it

Depend on a tag, not a branch — the tag *is* the version:

```toml
[dependencies]
oxidt-crypto = { git = "https://github.com/oxidt/oxidt-kit.git", tag = "oxidt-crypto-v0.1.0" }
oxidt-smtp   = { git = "https://github.com/oxidt/oxidt-kit.git", tag = "oxidt-smtp-v0.1.0" }
oxidt-auth   = { git = "https://github.com/oxidt/oxidt-kit.git", tag = "oxidt-auth-v0.12.0" }
oxidt-umami  = { git = "https://github.com/oxidt/oxidt-kit.git", tag = "oxidt-umami-v0.1.0" }
oxidt-s3     = { git = "https://github.com/oxidt/oxidt-kit.git", tag = "oxidt-s3-v0.1.0" }
oxidt-monitor = { git = "https://github.com/oxidt/oxidt-kit.git", tag = "oxidt-monitor-v0.1.0" }
oxidt-billing = { git = "https://github.com/oxidt/oxidt-kit.git", tag = "oxidt-billing-v0.2.0" }
oxidt-stripe = { git = "https://github.com/oxidt/oxidt-kit.git", tag = "oxidt-stripe-v0.1.0" }
oxidt-polar = { git = "https://github.com/oxidt/oxidt-kit.git", tag = "oxidt-polar-v0.1.0" }
oxidt-creem = { git = "https://github.com/oxidt/oxidt-kit.git", tag = "oxidt-creem-v0.1.0" }
```

`oxidt-auth` has no default features. Enable `server`, `web`, or both — apps
normally propagate both. Add `passkey-rp` to act as your own WebAuthn Relying
Party (see the design note below); it implies `server`.

`oxidt-umami` has one feature, `server` (the axum proxy routes); the client bridge
is target-gated instead of feature-gated, so the same calls compile to no-ops
in the server binary. Gate only the proxy behind your app's `server` feature:
`oxidt-umami = { …, features = ["server"] }` in the optional server dependency
position, or propagate `oxidt-umami/server` from your app's `server` feature.

CI checks each combination a real app ships, not just `--all-features`: an
optional feature is a configuration someone builds, and a misplaced `cfg` breaks
only that one.

If your app already has hundreds of `crypto::` / `smtp::` call sites, rename at
the dependency instead of touching them all:

```toml
crypto = { package = "oxidt-crypto", git = "https://github.com/oxidt/oxidt-kit.git", tag = "oxidt-crypto-v0.1.0" }
```

### Developing the kit from inside an app

Point the git dependency at your local checkout with a gitignored
`.cargo/config.toml` in the consuming app:

```toml
[patch."https://github.com/oxidt/oxidt-kit.git"]
oxidt-crypto = { path = "../../oxidt-kit/crates/oxidt-crypto" }
oxidt-smtp   = { path = "../../oxidt-kit/crates/oxidt-smtp" }
```

Edit in place, and cut a tag when the change settles. Because the patch lives in
an untracked file, CI still builds against the pinned tag.

### Releasing

Tag per crate so consumers can move independently:

```
git tag oxidt-crypto-v0.2.0 && git push origin oxidt-crypto-v0.2.0
```

Bump `version` in the crate's `Cargo.toml` in the same commit as the change, so
the tag and the manifest agree.

## Design notes

Where the source copies disagreed, the kit takes the safer option rather than
the most common one.

### oxidt-crypto

- **rand 0.9.** Argon2 salting uses argon2's own `rand_core` re-export, so the
  module does not care which `rand` major version the crate is on.
- **One PKCE implementation.** `verify_pkce_s256` compares in constant time;
  `pkce_s256_challenge` builds the challenge. `pkce_s256_matches` remains as a
  `#[deprecated]` alias for existing call sites.
- **Custom API-key prefixes.** `generate_api_key` mints `oat_` keys;
  `generate_prefixed_api_key("ipk_")` and `prefixed_api_key_prefix` let a
  project use its own prefix without forking the crate. `API_KEY_PREFIX_LEN`
  is 12.
- **`hash_api_key`** is a SHA-256 lookup hash for high-volume credential
  lookups, with docs on when to reach for it over Argon2.
- **AES-GCM nonce handling** validates the nonce length on decrypt instead of
  panicking on short input.

### oxidt-smtp

- **`SmtpSecurity` instead of `insecure: bool`.** Transport security is an
  explicit enum (`Tls`, `StartTls`, `None`) with no domain types from any app.
- **No magic hostnames.** Plaintext transport is only ever selected by
  `SmtpSecurity::None`, never inferred from the host — so a production relay
  that happens to be reachable as `localhost` cannot silently drop TLS.
- **Implicit TLS and STARTTLS both supported**, and the configured port is
  passed through to the relay builder rather than falling back to lettre's
  default.
- **Pooling + retry.** Clients build the transport once and retry transient
  failures with exponential backoff.
- **Timeouts, `List-Unsubscribe`, and `Error::is_permanent`.** Every send is
  bounded by 20s; bulk mail can carry one-click unsubscribe headers for the
  Gmail/Yahoo bulk-sender rules; callers can tell a 5xx from a 4xx to decide
  whether to suppress a recipient.
- **`send_email_with`** is the per-tenant path: fresh transport, single bounded
  attempt, no retry, so one hung customer relay cannot stall a shared queue.

### oxidt-auth

Reconciled from the six copies closest to `dx-saas-template`. The template copy
(byte-identical in mcpi) was the baseline and won almost everywhere; measured
drift was 0 for mcpi and 79–137 changed lines for dx-seo, mistral, dx-ideas,
cadence and dx-blog. Each decision:

- **`AuthRateLimitStore` is in, and it is why this extraction is worth doing.**
  Only 3 of 12 app copies had it; the other 9 fall back to an in-process
  limiter that allows N× the quota across N replicas. It stays a trait so the
  crate keeps no storage dependency, and `AuthState.rate_limit_store` is
  `Option` so an app can adopt the crate before wiring a backend.
- **`AUTH_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` as a named constant**, not the literal `20` five
  of the six copies inlined.
- **The layer-ordering comment is kept verbatim.** Axum applies the last
  `.layer()` outermost, so CSRF runs before rate limiting — deliberately, so a
  cross-origin POST is rejected before it can consume a real user's quota. That
  reasoning existed in one copy and is the kind of thing a reader silently
  "fixes" if it is not written down.
- **Hydration gating comes from dx-blog**, the one copy that had it. SSR paints
  the login form fully styled before the WASM bundle lands; a `<form>` whose
  `onsubmit` has not attached still does the browser's *native* submit on Enter,
  a GET that reloads the page and discards the typed email. `use_hydrated`
  plus a `disabled` `<fieldset>` closes that. cadence had a weaker inline
  version gating only the submit button, which does not stop implicit
  submission — the merge replaced it.
- **`handlers/dev_login.rs` is in**, `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` and additionally
  gated on `DEV_LOGIN=true` at runtime. Four of the six copies had dropped it.
- **The captcha stays optional.** It is inert unless `CAPTCHA_*` is configured,
  because a shared crate must not require an external service to be usable. As
  of oxidt-auth 0.4.0 bollwark is the only captcha: the built-in image CAPTCHA is
  gone, and with it `captcha-rs` and the 88 transitive crates it pulled in.
  Unconfigured, registration falls back to the allowlist alone.

#### The `passkey-rp` feature (v0.2.0)

Makes the app its own WebAuthn Relying Party: it runs the ceremonies and stores
credentials itself instead of proxying passkeys through the identity provider.

Needed because FerrisKey derives its RP ID from the IdP deployment's own origin,
which pins credentials there, and its enrollment endpoints require a FerrisKey
user JWT that email-OTP accounts can never obtain. An app whose accounts are
created by OTP therefore cannot offer passkeys at all through the IdP.

- **Additive, not an alternative.** seggwat runs its own RP *alongside* FerrisKey
  login — it has both `ferriskey/` and `webauthn.rs`. Enabling the feature does
  not commit you to dropping the IdP.
- **Scope is the RP core, not the login flow.** `webauthn.rs` imports nothing
  from the rest of the crate — options, registration and assertion verification
  are pure protocol code, which is why it can be shared without dragging session
  handling along. `session_auth.rs` differs by ~1,200 lines between the FerrisKey
  and self-owned architectures and is deliberately **not** part of this feature.
- **Off costs nothing.** `AuthState.passkey_store` and the two enroll routes only
  exist under the feature, so apps that leave it off compile unchanged and never
  link `ring` or `ciborium`.
- **Reconciled from seggwat and dx-admin**, whose copies were 842 lines apart by
  2 — a `seggwat_crypto::` vs `crypto::` rename. `passkey_enroll.rs` and
  `webauthn_helpers.rs` were byte-identical. dx-admin's trait docs won (they
  explain the sign-counter no-regress check and the `user_id` scoping that stops
  one user deleting another's credential); the browser globals were normalised
  from `window.__seggwat_*` to `window.__auth_*`, which dx-admin had inherited
  verbatim.
- **Brings the crate's only protocol tests** — 7 in `webauthn.rs`, covering RP-ID
  derivation and the verification paths.

The login page's hydration-stall notice expects a `.hydration-stall` CSS class
in the host app's stylesheet — a delayed reveal, since if the bundle never
arrives there is no Rust running to notice. Without the class the notice simply
shows immediately; nothing breaks.

### oxidt-s3

Four app copies were reviewed — seggwat (own SigV4 signer), stepshots and
dx-blog (`rust-s3`), and the template copy shared by mcpi, dx-admin and
gaiasana (`rust-s3`, never wired up). None was extracted as-is.

- **Own signer, not `rust-s3`.** The three `rust-s3` copies disable default
  features to get rustls, which also drops `fail-on-err`: non-2xx responses
  come back as `Ok`, and each copy compensated inconsistently — the template's
  `file_exists` was always `true`, `delete` never reported a 403,
  `verify_connection` passed with wrong keys. `rust-s3` also brings a second
  `reqwest` major, `attohttpc`, `rust-ini` and `sysinfo`. seggwat's ~250-line
  signer over the kit's existing `reqwest` + rustls stack won; its SigV4
  pitfalls (multi-value headers, encoded-form query ordering, non-ASCII header
  values) are fixed and the S3 API reference's worked examples pin it.
- **Operation surface from stepshots, URL model from dx-blog.** `NotFound` as a
  matchable variant, `public_url_base` for CDNs and Contabo's `tenant:bucket`,
  presigned PUT for direct browser uploads, the path-prefix round-trip
  invariant — keys are prefixed on the way in and stripped on the way out.
- **Policy stays in the app.** No 10 MiB cap, no image allow-list, no UUID key
  generation, no forced `Cache-Control` or `Content-Disposition`; every copy
  had baked one app's upload rules into the "generic" crate.
  `content_disposition_inline` / `_attachment` exist because non-ASCII
  filenames broke signing in two apps.
- **`exists` returns `Result<bool>`**, never a silent `false` on a network
  error — stepshots guarded a never-overwrite-the-original path on that.

### oxidt-monitor

Two copies, stepshots and infrapage, same 113/127-line file under the same name
(`server/admin_metrics.rs`) and already 102 lines apart. Both serve the same two
endpoints to the same board, so the drift was pure liability.

- **The paths are constants, not parameters.** `/health` and
  `/api/admin/metrics` are what the board polls across every project; an app
  free to choose its own path is an app that silently falls off the board.
  `health_response` and `metrics_response` are public for the app that
  genuinely must mount elsewhere.
- **No database, and no feature flag that would add one.** stepshots is on
  Postgres and infrapage's checks straddle Postgres and a cache, so both the
  probe list and the KPI list come from the app through `MonitorSource`. The
  crate never learns which engine is behind `"db"` — which is the point, since
  that key survived infrapage's Mongo→Postgres move unchanged.
- **`kpis()` is infallible.** Both copies degraded a failing count to `0`
  rather than 500 the whole response, so the board keeps its columns when one
  query breaks. The trait keeps that: absorb errors app-side.
- **No token means 404, not 401.** Taken from both copies — an endpoint that is
  switched off should not advertise that it exists.
- **Token comparison now hashes first.** Both copies hand-rolled a `ct_eq` that
  returned early on a length mismatch, which leaks the expected token's length
  despite the comment saying otherwise. `MonitorToken` compares two SHA-256
  digests under `subtle`, so the compare is fixed-width. Adopters lose nothing:
  the accepted token is unchanged.
- **`delta_24h` is omitted, never null.** The board tells "this KPI has no
  delta" from "the delta is zero", and both copies already relied on the key
  being absent.

## Coming from your own copy?

If you are replacing a hand-rolled copy of either crate, these are the
signatures most likely to differ:

- `SmtpConfig { insecure: true }` → `SmtpConfig { security: SmtpSecurity::None }`.
- `SmtpClientImpl::new(config)` returns `Result<Self>`, not a bare `Self`.
- `SmtpSecurity` lives in `oxidt_smtp`; enable the `serde` feature to keep it
  serializable in persisted settings.
- `pkce_s256_challenge` and `hash_api_key` are exported from the `oxidt_crypto`
  root, not from submodules.
